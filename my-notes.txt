Term/Definition
absolute path: A path that refers to a particular location in
a file system. Abso;ute paths are usually written with respect
to the file system's root directory, and begin with either
"/" (on Unix) or "\" (on Microsoft Windows). An example of
absolute path is /homeappacademy/Downloads which would be the
path for the directory that contains downloads for the
"appacademy" account.

command-line interface: A user interface on typing commands
that interact with files and the operating system. On Windows,
you will use the Ubuntu environment for that. On macOS, you
will use Terminal.

Current working directory: The directory that relative paths
are calculated from; equivalently, the place where files
referenced by name only are searched for. The current working
directory is usually reffered to using the shorthand notation
"." (pronounced "dot").

file system: A set of file and directions. A file system may
be spread across many physical devices, or many file systems
may be sotred on a single physical device; the operating
system manages access.

filename extension: The portion of a file's name that comes
after the final "." character. By convention this identifies
the files's type: .txt meant "text" file, .png means "Portable
Networkd Graphics" file, and so on. These conventions are not
enforced by most operating systems: it is perfectly possible
(but confusing!) to name an MP3 sound file "homepage.html"
which makes it look like an HTML file showing content in
a Web browser!

home directory: the default directory associated with an
account on a computer system. By convention for your account,
all of your files are stored in or below your home directory.
On macOS, that is found in the /Users/"your-name" K directory.
ON Ubuntu, you can find your home directory under /home/"your-name".
On Windows, you will find it under C:\Users\"your-name". On Ubuntu
and macOS, the shortcut for your home directory is "~".

operating system: Software that manages interactions between users,
hardware, and software processes. Common examples are Linux, macOS,
and Windows.

parent directory: The directory that "contains" the one in question.
Every directory in a file systm except the root directory has a
parent. A directory's parent is usually referred to using the shorthand
notation ".." (pronounced "dot dot").

path: A unique description that specifies the location of a
file or a directory within a file system. There are two kinds of
paths: absolute paths and relative paths.

relative path: A path that specifies the location of a file or a
directory with respect to the current working directory. Any path
that does not begin with a pather seperator character, "/" on
Ubuntu and macOS, is a relative path. The path "Documents/contracts/"
is a relative path from the current working directory into a
"Contracts" subdirectory. You know that "Contracts" is a subdirectory
because there's another path seperator ("/") after it.

root directory: The top-most directory in a file system. On macOS
and Ubuntu it's name is "/".

Shell: A command-line interface such as Bash or Z shell allows you
to interact with the operating system.

subdirectory: A directory sontained within another directory. All
directories except the root directory are subdirectories.

wildcard: A character used to specify a pattern match. In Bash
or Z shell, the wildcard character "*" matches zero or more
characters. This means that "*.txt" would match any name that
ends with ".txt".

//Introducing the shell
GUI = graphical user interface

Most popular Unix shell = "Bash"

ls = list
clear = clear
cd or ~ = home
pwd = "present working directory"
cd / = change directory
/ = root directory
-F = fancy

-a = do not ignore entires that begin with "."
-l = tells commands to show lots of information
about each entry
-F = appends an indicator to inform you of
the kind of entry it is

arguments specify files or directories on which
the command should operate

/bin/ls is the executable file the operating system
run every time you type ls

absolute paths begin with "/"

".." = the directory contining this one (the parent
of the current directory)

Learned:
= The file system is responsible for managing information
on the disk.
= Information is stored in files, which are stored in
directories.
= Directories can also store other sirectories, which
forms a "directory tree".
= cd path changes the present working directory to the
indicated path.
= ls path prints a listing of a specific file or directory;
ls on its own lists the contents of the present working directory.
= pwd prints the user's present working directory.
= / on its own is the ROOT DIRECTORY of the whole file system.
= A RELATIVE PATH specifies a location starting from the current
location.
= An ABSOLUTE PATH specifies a location from the root of the file
system.
= Directory names in a path are seperated with / on Unix-like
systems.
= ".." means 'the directory above the current one'.

mkdir - make directory
explorer.exe . = file explorer

Don't use spaces when creating files!
Don't begin the name with a dash!
Stick with letters, numbers, periods, dashes in between,
and/or underscores in between!

If you need to refer to names of files or directories that
have spaces or other special characters, you should surround
the name in quotes ("").
